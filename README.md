# Summary Of Architecture

The proposed solution is a highly available microservices architecture deployment solution for a telecom sector software system. The system is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with high availability to ensure that there is no single point of failure. The architecture also includes proper load balancing, scalability, fault tolerance, and auto-recovery considerations to ensure that the system can handle large amounts of traffic and recover from any failures.

The deployment process is automated using CI/CD strategies with Jenkins Pipeline, and GitOps as FluxCD. This approach ensures that any changes made to the codebase are automatically deployed to the production environment after successful tests are performed. The codebase is also analyzed using SonarQube for code analysis to ensure that the code is of high quality and meets the required standards.

Observability across the entire architecture is maintained using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization, and EFK stack for logging and alerting strategies. This ensures that any issues are quickly identified and resolved before they can cause any significant downtime.

For knowledge base and configurations, secrets management is integrated with the system to ensure that all sensitive information is securely stored and managed. The entire infrastructure is deployed as code, which means that changes are tracked, versioned, and tested just like any other code.

Overall, this solution provides a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant telecom grade system, and the tools and strategies used are justified based on their effectiveness in the market.
